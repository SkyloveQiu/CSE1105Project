## Description of project
The problem presented by the client consisted of the dificulty surrounding reserving a room on the university campus. With no booking system in place, there were no guarantees that when needed, the requested room would be available.
To further facilitate the campus management, the client introduced the idea of reserving food from the stalls available on campus. In addition, if you were to reserve a room on campus, he thought it would be useful to be able to order food and have it delivered at the room you are working in.
Moreover, the client mentioned the always have a bike at hand. His idea was to have bikes available to rent-for-a-day around the TU Delft campus.
These concepts and ideas really excited us to start working on a solution to this problem!
