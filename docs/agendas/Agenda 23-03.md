* Finish the bike page.
* Finish the calendar.
* Implement the old CRUD into the new GUI.
* Finish the report V.1.
* Filtering thread in the GUI.


# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
Ziang BUG with the tests.

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

# Question round
Are there any questions?

What do you expect us to deliver for the report?
