# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

- Rubric asks for how we designed the system architecture in the second video, what exactly do they mean with the system architecture for this?

# Time for TA

# Closing
