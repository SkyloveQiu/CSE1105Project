# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*
Is everything in the agenda?

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
* Present Demo\
// Jordy says we are a little bit ahead\
// Builds check, api check, ui check, no tests (Andrew had some but on a website).\
// Ziang shows the web app test. \
// Private methods need to be covered with public methods and those needs to be tested.\
* Making the API for login
* Make the HTTP request login
* Fix the checking methods in the login and register page
* Fixing the scrolling for the Main Page and Login Page and Register Page
* FIX THE API
* Integrate APIs into front-end
* Buildings and rooms in database with JSON

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*\
//Ziang: Can we do the verification via client-side? Jordy: I can not directly help you but there are some tutorials online that can help you.\
//Scorion is mandatory. Private feedback is generally more with issues with team members so it's not mandatory. Public feedback in general should be positive and 'negative'.\
// Where can I find the task division?\
// Use the issue board. Be specific. When is a task completed?\
// Try to look at the rubrics and determine what to do.\
// All of the classes need javadoc.\
// Checkstyle is handy.


# Question round
Are there any questions?\
//There are no more questions.

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*\
//Jordy closes the meeting.
