## Head TA about the communication skills:

	> Be more helpful; tell other people the problem and ask for help; then others actively help the teammembers
	
	> Respect the planning; Make meetings and stick to the times of those. + have a responsible person (rotating through members eg. the chair)
	
	> The communication is superficial + the comments are too general.

## Tasks from T.A:
