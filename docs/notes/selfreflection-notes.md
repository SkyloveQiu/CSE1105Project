##Dot

Definition of tasks - sufficient

* Whenever we create an issue, we should implement a clear Definition of Done.
* Add a weight to the task, so we know how important it is.

##Dow

Distribution of work - excellent

* Thom disagreed and stated that he hears from Niels that he feels like isn't really doing anything next to paperwork.
* More communication in the database duo.
* More communication in general between client and server-side.

##Com

Communication - sufficient

* Merge requests: development to master needs all people. Feature to development requires 3 people.
* (During the TA-meeting Jordy stated that 3 or 4 should be enough)

##S-R

Self-reflection - insufficient

* We are doing that at this moment.
* Weekly reports of how it went: what went well and what went wrong? How do we improve on that?

* We took a look and discussed it.

##Style

Style - insufficient

* We worked on it for the client the hours before the TA-meeting, using checkstyle.
* Server side will also do checkstyle.

Code reviewing - sufficient

* Code is not yet enough reviewed. Several people from different duo-groups should take a look at the code.
* Merge requests require comments from the approvers.
