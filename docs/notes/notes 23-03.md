## Questions bike reservation the food reservation: food also reservation?

	> Food does not have to be reserved, what you have now is a good way to do it, but also make it a possibility to pick up the food instead of having it delivered to a specific room
	
	> Bike reservation needs to have an end time or at least a restriction.

## Question about report: what is it you expect us to deliver?

    - General announcement has information
    - Recommend: look at rubric (bottom grading report)
    - all work together
    
    - Do you expect us to deliver a video already?
    	1. Soft deadline on next monday
    	2. Draft report
    	3. TA will give feedback on friday
		


## Questions on the feedback
	1. git + tools are doing well
	2. code reviewing : 	did not see andrei show up much
			 	I encourage to have everyone stay active.
			 	When starting on an issue immediately start a WIP merge request
	3. SR havent done that
	4. Testing you are still working on that
	
	> Start of and end the week with a meeting: **not have only 1 person start this up, this is a group project!**
	> Appoint 1 person for a week to be responsible for this!
	
	- Impression: 
	    > Determine what tasks are needed to be finished and AFTER THAT assign the people who will do what task!

	- In general: 
	    > please keep communicating, in discord as well as gitlab (issues)
	    
    - One issue with issues in gitlab: 	
	    > move issues to the correct column, to do, doing, closed.
		> f issues are not in correct column or whatever message the person of the issue and ask them what is up and if they need help


	- Main key of this project is **communication**!
	    > It is good that you use discord, but keep in mind to also use gitlab as well, because it is really handy (and a focus of this project)


## How is our progress?
	> I feel like you are a bit behind thanks to your rework of the UI but if you keep working you guys can still make it work
