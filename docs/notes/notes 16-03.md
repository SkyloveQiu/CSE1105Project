# Any other business

# Question round
Ziang: After merge my tests are gone, and I can't resolve it.
Cristen: what's the question mark in the agenda.
    
    (TA)
    The DoW is not fair, some people did not contribute to the repository, just saw Thom did the work
    peole did not make the issues. Make the issues more clear and help the team work better. 
    
    Self-reflection
    Can be done better, can not only use "we should finish something" but we should give the exactly 
    what have to be done.The example of the self-reflection is posted on the mattermost, we can take the example.]
    The reflection is not sufficient, and we should make a time to make a reflection together, not base on personnally.
    
    code reviewing
    He can't see all the people attend the code reivew. We only have a little bit people provide feedback. 
    People should leave the comment on what is changing in that merge request.And everyone has chance to make a merge request.
    
    For the tests, people should write the tests for their own the piece of code. Some one who didn't do code
    can write the tests for other people. 
    
    The ddl of progress is fine, but the gui havn't implemented.
    
    The tests are not enough, we have show the coverage of the tests.
    
    Distribution of the work, some people need to do more work last week. Niels and Einar needs to do more work.
    
    


# Time for TA
*If the TA has things he wants to say or discuss he can ask them now. If he needs more time for this the Question Round can be shortened.*

# Closing
*Now you can continue working on the project. Good luck!*
